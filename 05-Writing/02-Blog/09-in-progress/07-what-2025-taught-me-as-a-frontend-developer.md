Hi it's RJ, and today I want to share what 2025 taught me about learning frontend development through deliberate experimentation and framework exploration.

## The Problem

When I started my frontend journey in January 2025, I made a common mistake—I obsessed over tools instead of fundamentals. Three months disappeared into perfecting my Neovim setup with countless YouTube tutorials, building a minimal configuration without plugins like statusline, lualine, or mason.

The issue wasn't the tool obsession itself—it was that I was learning in isolation. I configured LSP servers manually and rewrote my setup for Neovim 0.11+ native approach, but I wasn't building anything real. Comfortable tools became an excuse to avoid the discomfort of actual coding.

## The Framework Struggle

By March, I finally started coding, but jumped straight into React without solid JavaScript fundamentals. The concepts—hooks, state management, component lifecycle—felt impossible. Instead of retreating to basics, I pushed through, comparing React patterns to JavaScript.

This created a frustrating cycle: I'd copy code from tutorials, paste it into ChatGPT asking "How would a senior dev implement this?", and learn patterns without understanding the underlying decisions. It worked superficially—I became "comfortable" with React basics after 4-5 months—but the knowledge felt fragile.

## The Breaking Point

August brought my first real technical crisis—I couldn't figure out how to fetch and render local markdown files in React. This led me to explore framework hopping as a learning strategy. (You can [read](How%20I%20Learn%20from%20Trying%20Different%20Frameworks.md) more about this approach in my post on learning through different frameworks.)

The key insight wasn't mastering any specific tool, but learning when to explore alternatives versus deepen my current knowledge.

## The Turning Point

In October, I applied these lessons to my blog project. I returned to React with fresh perspective, understanding that Vite docs held the answers for local data fetching that React's documentation didn't cover.

A YouTube video about building an animated table of contents inspired me to study unified and understand compile-time vs. runtime processing. By month's end, I deployed my blog to Cloudflare. It wasn't perfect—messy with AI-generated sections—but it worked.

## Key Takeaway

2025 taught me that the most valuable learning happens through deliberate detours. Framework hopping isn't random experimentation—it's comparative learning that reveals why certain tools excel at specific problems.

The detours gave me perspective: Neovim taught patience and environment importance, React struggles built ecosystem understanding, and framework exploration showed me when to stick with tools versus explore alternatives.

Most importantly, I learned that AI accelerates learning without replacing critical thinking. When used thoughtfully, it becomes a collaborator that helps you understand patterns and make informed decisions.

As I build more complex systems, I'm carrying these lessons: embrace confusion as a learning opportunity, learn from mistakes, and remember that what feels like "wasted" time often contains exactly what you need.
