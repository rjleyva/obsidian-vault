> Kenneth and I met with Jenna and Chris. They are happy with CAMD and have no
> issues. Before starting the SIQ demo, we had a brief discussion about job
> matching, as they were not fully familiar with it. During the call, they mentioned
> they are using an HRIS system, so I offered an additional demo for CA Plus.
> Kenneth will send the free trial for SIQ.
