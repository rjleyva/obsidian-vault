So with JA alone , you can only create a workflow, and then managers who is a part of the workflow will recieve a link that would take them to the job that they need ot work on and that pretty much it, But if you have Elevate, managers would get the notification via email then they will go through elevate to get access to the job description, which is more secure way to share and collaboarate.

## Q\&A

- Can you share a little bit about communication with employees?

- Are you sharing the JD with you employees?

- Do you have like a center where you can share you JD?, or maybe your HRIS system where employees can access their JD? Is that something that you do right now?

- “Can you walk me through how you communicate job expectations and responsibilities to employees?” (Follow-up probes below to guide deeper insight.)

- Follow-up prompts: • “Do employees currently have easy access to their job descriptions?” • “Is there a centralized system — like an HRIS or internal portal — where those role definitions are stored and regularly updated?” • “When was the last time employees were encouraged to review their job descriptions or skill expectations?” • “Do managers use JDs during performance reviews or development planning conversations?”

## Q\&A

- Can you share a little bit about communication with employees?

- Are you sharing the JD with you employees?

- Do you have like a center where you can share you JD?, or maybe your HRIS system where employees can access their JD? Is that something that you do right now?

- So, if we purchase a job architect and then we purchase elevate, we can send job description and copy of their pay Communication?

    - With JA and Elevate, you can create a job description using JA and then share it in a centralized and secure location within Elevate. However, to share pay communications with your employees, you will need a subscription to CA Plus.

- Will I need to pay extra for pay communication separate from what I'm gonna be paying from for Job Description? Or if I have elevate, it will allow me to share content to our employees whether that's pay communication and you know like their job description.

    - Yes, there is an additional charge: `1 per Pay Communication and `0.75 per shared Job Description.

- Do I need to pay extra to do that? (related to the no 2.)

    - Yes, there is an additional charge: `1 per Pay Communication and `0.75 per shared Job Description.

- If we do not have single sign on right now, is that can we provide like unique login credential store employees to each individual?

    - As far as I know, Elevate does not support integration with third-party security software, but I can double-check that for you. Our native Single Sign-On (SSO) and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) are free of charge, and we highly recommend using them for a simpler and more secure login experience for your employees.

- So, you can be very flexible when it comes to pricing upon approval. Is that what you're saying?

    - I can discuss with our leadership team and work to get the best possible price for you

- so, right now we have 700 employees, right? if we grow, let's say we add a few more folks this year and next year, will the price also change?

    - Yes, our pricing is primarily based on FTE counts. However, with Elevate, you can take advantage of a long-term contract to lock in the price for the next few years, even if your employee count grows.

- Implementation of elevate. Is this Gonna be implemented the same time frame as Job Architect or is there a seperate implementation there?

    - Regarding the implementation process, I’ll need to confirm, as it depends on the amount of data and the number of users/accounts you need for Elevate. Typically, though, it only takes 24–48 hours.

- How are we gonna provide access to our employees for Elevate? Are we gonna give them like login credentials? Do you support single sign on?

    - We’ll create an account for each employee, and they’ll have their own login credentials for Elevate. Once logged in, they can customize their account and update their password directly in the system.
