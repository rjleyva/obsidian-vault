## Job Architect Landing Page

This is the main landing page of Job Architect.

We do not charge per-user licenses here, so if you need multiple licenses that is perfectly fine.

You can incorporate any language, however, the user interface is only available in English.

Assuming that you have over 100 jobs and upload them to the system, you'll be able to see them listed here.

From here, you'll be able to see all your descriptions, not only the approved version but also those that are in progress.

You can also include other data points, in a job level within the JA platform, so on top of the title description, you can have your own internal job code, family, and job level as you continue to grow there will be an audit trail, you'll be able to see who was the last person who modified that specific job description, and when was the last time it was modified.

You can also look at the history, and being able to compare the previous and current versions.

And once you click on compare, it will give you a side-by-side-by-side view of the current and previous versions.

And whichever fields that are modified or omitted will be highlighted as well.

We can also work with you to customize the final output, once you export the job description from the system whether as Word or PDF, we can import your company logo, customize the color, and other stuff that you want to edit.

Typically our clients have one template for internal usage and another format that is readily available for job posting.

## Manage Template

From here you'll be able to create your template, you'll be able to manage the template you can use going forward for all of your job descriptions, and you'll have access to the STD template of [Salary.com](http://salary.com/) that you can also modify.

So you can create a customized drop-down list, if you want certain fields to be restricted by other users to be modified and maybe only yourself, you can make those changes as an admin.

You can add more fields for duties and responsibilities.

This is also the part where you can change the level of education, this is something that we can customize for you as well.

And for anyone who will be involved in the process of writing the job description.

You can create instructions for each field so they will be guided accordingly.

This is where creating workflow will come in, instead of sending msg or emails or other media of communication that you have, you'll be able to set up those workflows and you can set up as many as you want and it's very simple to create one from scratch.

## Workflow

So maybe you want to create a workflow for your HR Department and you need to include a Department Head.

Let’s say there will be 4 people involved in this, each given a few days, if it’s turn they will receive a notification and the last person will approve or deny the job description.

## Skills Library Demo

Our Skills Library is available within CompAnalyst as well, if you purchase it, you can have access to the portal where you can retrieve the content.

We have a dedicated science team who are experts in ensuring that the content in our library is up to-date and relevant to the external market.

_FUNDAMENTALS behind the update._

Our team will use different job boards to do their research to understand what are the top skills that different companies are looking for in a specific job profile. Different job boards are being used to maintain the relevance of our content under the skills library. Our data science team is doing all the leg work so you don't have to do it yourself.

This is how it looks like once you purchase our skills library. The good thing about this is you don't have to buy it as a whole database, you'll have the option to purchase it per family.

### **Click Job Family**

From this point, you will find a list of job categories that you can purchase individually based on your preferences. For instance, if you wish to begin with Finance and Accounting, choose that option and click APPLY.

Now, you'll be able to see different job profiles under that category.

And now we are looking at different jobs with different levels.

If you click a specific job profile, it will show you the same information available in CompAnalyst Market Data like, the job levels, family, job description, and even the duties and responsibilities.

If you scroll it further, you can see the list of competencies/skills with proficiency levels required for this job.

**In this example Accountant I, having Account Reconciliation you'll expect them to have level 1.**

**Hover your mouse to the INFORMATION ICON below proficiency level.**

You will be able to view the general definition for each level. For example, level I is General Familiarity. Additionally, we will provide you with specific behavioral indicators for that skill and proficiency level, which will be helpful for performance evaluation and other purposes.

All of the reports can be exported to PDF files which can be shared with other departments like training and development or maybe with your employees so that they have an understanding of the expectations and qualities that they need to have for them to perform the role effectively.

### Sample Report

And this is what the sample report looks like.

The first page contains the job information.

Below is the list of required competencies and skills, with detailed explanations of proficiency levels and behavioral indicators.

### Close the SAMPLE REPORT

## Compare Different Position within the same Job Focus

That is one way to look at it.

Many of our clients are using Skills Library to compare different job profiles.

### Select multiple job levels then click compare

Let's say you are attempting to comprehend the varying proficiency levels required for different positions within the same job focus.

Now you will have a side by side by side view of the different job profiles you selected and have a much better picture of the differences.

As you can see, for Accountants I and II, the proficiency level is the same, but as they progress from Accountant II to Level III, that proficiency level will also change.

And if you scroll all the way down to the bottom, you will see some skills that are not being shared, so if you are comparing Accountants I and II, you'll see here that Bank Reconciliation is a specific skill that will be ideal to have if they are moving up to the ladder, and that is the other way to look at skills content for different levels in the same focus.

## Compare Job Profiles that could be part of Different Job Families

Some of our clients will also look at different job profiles that could be part of different job families.

Let's say, Jefferson our accountant I, needs to be transferred to another function like Accounts Payable Analyst II, same process, select the job title with the appropriate level and hit compare.

From here, you'll be able to guide Jefferson, if he wants to be transferred to this new role these are the new competencies and skills he needs to acquire for him to get qualified and perform effectively.

## Add Unique Job Profiles and Skills

**ADD BUTTON** allows you to add unique job profiles and skills and be able to define the behavioral indicators that could be unique to your organization.

From the content library, you'll see that the skills library added there is where you can access the skills content that you will be purchasing.

Let's say, you're writing a job description for Project Manager, on the right you'll have a more targeted list under Skills Library.

From here you'll be able to link content to your internal job so that whenever we push an update you'll receive that notification that some competencies and skills were added and you'll have the option to let that flow to your job description.

You can also add more fields. (Duties and Responsibilities).

## Search Content Library

You can use all your existing job descriptions as your content source, you'll also have access to our job descriptions which are being updated monthly, and online job postings.

So let's say, CompAnalyst Market data, this is a really good source because this is being reviewed by Salary.com

You can start by typing the job title, you can look at the summary or other fields here.

You can copy and paste the title for you to have more targeted results.

And now we have these results, looking at the list, let's say entry-level, so you'll gonna look at project manager I, and there you go, now you have access to the job information, now it's gonna be very easy for you to adapt to this content.

As you can see, you have a side-by-side view of your ongoing report and different content sources available instead of opening another tab or maybe going to another website.

Let's say, the details you looking at are exactly what you are looking for, you can simply copy and paste, drag and drop every single detail, or even copy everything by clicking COPY ALL and it will bring all the content to your draft, and from here you can easily remove all the unnecessary details.

But let's say you want to take a look at other content sources like online job posting.

You can highlight some of the information and paste it into your content.

**We are scraping thousands/millions of job descriptions that you can use as a guideline in creating your job description.**

Now another best-selling functionality is spell check, there are also times when our clients want to turn on bias check so if there are any words that are included in your content that can potentially demotivate someone to like, raise, gender age, all those will be flag by the system and will provide you some recommendation to replace that word.

You can ignore or update them.

And if you need to involve someone you can click on, SUBMIT, and send for REVIEW.

From here you'll be able to select a specific workflow, let say you need to include a dept head, so let's say this is going to be for an admin type of workflow, you select that workflow and whoever is involved in that workflow will receive a notification if it's their turn.

Or maybe this is more ad-hoc, not necessarily need to include a lot of people, maybe just someone, type in their email address, even if they don't have access to JA, they can be involved in the process. and they'll receive a one-time token link, you can also add some comment or special instructions and click on APPLY.

## Q\&A Job Architect

**Can I import my job descriptions into JobArchitect, or do I have to start from scratch?** If your job descriptions are housed in Word documents, or in a system that can export them to Excel/CSV, we can import your existing descriptions into JobArchitect.
