# [[CompAnalyst Market Data]] Dagger Icon Explanation

## Without a Dagger

Compensation data shown without a dagger means it’s an exact match to the selected job, industry, company size, and location. In other words, the selected scope perfectly aligns with the survey data.

## Single Dagger

Compensation marked with the † symbol indicates that actual survey data is available and closely aligns with the selected scope, though it is not an exact match. This occurs when one or two of the selected criteria can be matched, but not all three. In these cases, the reported organization and incumbent counts reflect the full survey sample rather than the specific scope.

## Double Dagger

Compensation marked with the ‡ symbol indicates that direct survey data was not available for the selected scope. This usually happens when a role is uncommon for a specific location, industry, or company size, or when scopes are very narrowly defined. In these cases, compensation figures are thoughtfully projected using established adjustment factors applied to national survey data. To increase the likelihood of receiving results based on actual survey data, we recommend broadening the selected scopes where possible while still accurately representing your competitive labor market.
