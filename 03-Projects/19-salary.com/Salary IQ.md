Eli what your seing on my screen right now is CompAnaylist Market Data, I'm showing this to you for a reason Eli, This is our bread and butter here, 100% HR Reported information, no crowdsource, no self-employee reported, updated on a monthly basis to make sure that you are on top of where you are and where you need to be.

Salary IQ is built to work well with CompAnalyst Market Data.

In fact, next month we will integrate Salary IQ to CompAnalyst Analyst Market Data, so now our partners will get two sets of data in one run, HR Reported and employer reported data.

Two of the most reliable data in HR Spectrum.
